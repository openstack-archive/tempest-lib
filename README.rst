As of the 1.0.0 release tempest-lib as a separate repository and project
is deprecated. The library now exists as part of the tempest project, all
future development will occur there. To use the library for future releases
update your imports from tempest_lib to tempest.lib, and add tempest>=10
to your project requirements.
